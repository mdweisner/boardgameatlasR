Description: A basic API
            wrapper for querying the Board Game Atlas (BGA) search API,
            found at https://www.boardgameatlas.com/api.
            BGA is an website that catalogs board game information
            and statistics, such as the mechanics, number of players,
            and playtime. The boardgameatlasR app will allow users to query
            the API and coerce the retrieved games into a tidy format.
            It also includes metrics on review scores of the games,
            review text, recent comments of the game on www.reddit.com, and more.
            For full information on the API, please consult https://www.boardgameatlas.com/api/docs.
